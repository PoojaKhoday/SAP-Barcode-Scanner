- REST API setup and testing  
- Dynamic UI binding for displaying results  
- End to end preview and testing on a mobile device

Features  
- Mobile friendly UI  
- Barcode scanning using device camera  
- REST API integration (OpenFoodFacts)  
- Dynamic binding of product name, image, and energy value  
- Visual logic flows (no code required)  

Tools Used
